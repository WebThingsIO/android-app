# WebThings Android App
A Web of Things client for Android.

The WebThings Android app is a general purpose Web of Things (WoT) client which can be used to directly discover, monitor and control [web things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/), and collections of web things in a [WoT directory](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/#exploration-directory). This includes interacting with native web things like those created with the [WebThings Framework](https://webthings.io/framework/), and collections of web things hosted by Web of Things gateways like [WebThings Gateway](https://webthings.io/gateway/).
